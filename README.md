React hooks like no other! ⚡

Use alongside other great libraries, there are no plans to reproduce all common hooks.

## Features:

- 💪 `useConditionalHooks` - break the rules (safely) - call a dynamic list of hooks conditionally
- ⏳ `useBusy` - keep track of your async operations
- ☝️ `useInputDevice` - keep track of currently active input device
- 📅 `useToday` - keep track of day changes
- 🔄 `useUpdateEvery` - force render every interval set

## Batteries included:

- 🛠 First class TypeScript support - 100% type safe and intellisense friendly
- 🌎 Universal - exposes both ESM modules and CommonJS

## Usage
