React hooks like no other! ⚡

Use alongside other great libraries, there are no plans to reproduce all "common" hooks.
If a hook is there, it's either unique, rare, super optimized or just needed for other hooks.

## Features:

- 💪 `useConditionalHooks` - break the rules (safely) — call hooks conditionally, use a dynamic list of hooks
- 🪄 `useEffect2` - `useEffect` that gives you previous values
- ⏳ `useBusy` - keep track of your async operations
- 📨 `useCrossTabs` - hook for cross-tab communication
- 📨 `useCrossTabsMessage` - easily listen to messages from other tabs
- 2️⃣ `useDetectMultiTabs` - detect if there are multiple tabs of your app open
- 🔄 `useForceUpdate` - force render on demand
- 🌐 `useGeolocation` - keep track of user's geolocation (super optimized)
- 🌐 `useSimpleGeolocation` - keep track of user's geolocation (simplified)
- ☝️ `useInputDevice` - keep track of a currently active input device
- 🥇 `useIsFirstRender` - keep track of first render
- 💾 `useMemoizedFn` - improve performance by memoizing functions
- 🎭 `useProxyRef` - wraps your ref with a Proxy for full control
- 🎭 `useForwardedProxyRef` - wraps forwarded ref with a Proxy for full control
- 📅 `useToday` - keep track of day changes
- 🔄 `useUpdateEvery` - force render every interval set

## Batteries included:

- 🛠 First class TypeScript support - 100% type safe and intellisense friendly
- 🌎 Universal - exposes both ESM modules and CommonJS
